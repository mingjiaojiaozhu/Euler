# Prime permutations

```
The arithmetic sequence 1487, 4817, 8147 in which each of the terms increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways:
    (i) each of the three terms are prime
    (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another
There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2- or 3-digit primes, exhibiting this property,
but there is one other 4-digit increasing sequence.
What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?
