# Number spiral diagonals

```
Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction, a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:
    21 22 23 24 25
    20 07 08 09 10
    19 06 01 02 11
    18 05 04 03 12
    17 16 15 14 13
It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.
What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
