# Even Fibonacci numbers

```
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
    1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
