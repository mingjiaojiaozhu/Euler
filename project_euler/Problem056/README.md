# Powerful digit sum

```
A googol (10^100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100^100 is almost unimaginably large:
one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.
Considering natural numbers of the form, a^b, where a, b<100, what is the maximum digital sum?
