# Largest exponential

```
Comparing two numbers written in index form like 2^11 and 3^7 is not difficult,
as any calculator would confirm that 2^11=2048<3^7=2187.
However, confirming that 632382^518061>519432^525806 would be much more difficult,
as both numbers contain over three million digits.
Using base_exp.txt, a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line,
determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.
NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above.
