# Amicable numbers

```
Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a)=b and d(b)=a, where a!=b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220)=284.
The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284)=220.
Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
