# Coin partitions

```
Let p(n) represent the number of different ways in which n coins can be separated into piles.
For example, five coins can separated into piles in exactly seven different ways, so p(5)=7.

    4+1
    3+2
    3+1+1
    2+2+1
    2+1+1+1
    1+1+1+1+1
Find the least value of n for which p(n) is divisible by one million.
