# Combinatoric selections

```
There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:
    123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, 345
In combinatorics, we use the notation, C(5,3)=10.
In general, C(n,r)=n!/r!(n-r)!, where r<=n, n!=n*(n-1)*...*1 and 0!=1.
It is not until n=23, that a value exceeds one-million: C(23,10)=1144066 
How many, not necessarily distinct, values of C(n,r), for 1<=n<=100, are greater than one-million?
