You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

    Thirty days has September, April, June and November.
    All the rest have thirty-one, Saving February alone, which has twenty-eight, rain or shine, and on leap years, twenty-nine.
    A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 20000)?
