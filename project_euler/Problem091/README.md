# Right triangles with integer coordinates

```
The points P(x1,y1) and Q(x2,y2) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin O(0,0), to form OPQ.
There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies
between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is 0<=x1,y1,x2,y2<=2.
Given that 0<=x1,y1,x2,y2<=50, how many right triangles can be formed?
